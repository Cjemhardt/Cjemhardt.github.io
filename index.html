      <td>The Revere Copper Co. contract of June 1863 was for forty-six cents per pound,9 [a common method of buying ordnance] which make the Revere Napoleon cost about $485.00. This was a real bargain for the time considering the cost of metal, and foundry and machine work — especially boring a 4.62-inch hole over six feet long in tough bronze. As they stand today, the market value of the cannons is in excess of $60,000 each, but their unique role in San Diego’s past history places them beyond price, literally our own “national treasures.”\n“El Justin,” the first gun restored, has its foundry number “290” stamped on the right trunnion collar. It weighs 1213 pounds and was accepted by the U.S. Ordnance Department on August 26, 1863, by the Chief of Ordnance Thomas Jackson Rodman, who assigned the gun Number 289, one of one hundred Napoleons he accepted that date from the Revere Copper Company.</td>

      <td>Description:\nThough weighing over 1,200 pounds, the 12-pounder Napoleon field guns or "gun-howitzers" were considered light artillery and were the most widely used artillery pieces of the Civil War, and the Revere Copper Co. manufactured more of them than another other foundry, 461 of the roughly 1,157 manufactured in the North during the war (see page 91 of "Field Artillery Weapons of the Civil War" by Hazlett). Additional Revere Napoleons appear to have been made for individual states. 36% of the Union artillery pieces at Gettysburg were Napoleons, and 130 Napoleons were used by the Union forces at Antietam. The company was the descendant of Paul Revere's foundry in Boston. The Napoleon 12-pounders could fire solid shot or explosive shells nearly a mile (max range of 1,600+ yards) as well as shot for closer range engagements. They are also historically significant as the last cast bronze cannons used by the U.S. military. The muzzle is marked "No. 385 REVERE COPPER CO 1233 lbs. C.C. 1864" and has a blade front sight. The tube has "U.S." in ornate letters on top near the trunnions. The ornate nature of this marking is one of the distinctive aspects of the Revere guns. The bore at the muzzle measures approximately 4.62 inches, and the bore length is roughly 63 1/2 inches. It is mounted on a Paulson Bros. Ordnance reproduction carriage with a set of accoutrements.\n\nRating Definition:\nFine with dark aged patina throughout, some mild wear on the carriage including oxidation on the tires, and general mild wear from age, storage, and period use.

      <td>The Visitors Center is located at 5201 Urbana Pike, Frederick, MD 21704. There is no entrance fee, but you should stop there to pick up a brochure and get oriented. There’s a small gift shop, and a very well-done museum upstairs. The one real piece of artillery on the field is also located by the entrance – a beautiful Revere Copper Co. Napoleon. All other cannons on the field are reproductions.</td>

      <td>Iowa Civil War Monuments\nMarshall County: Marshalltown\nGPS Coordinates: 42.054133 by -92.933083\nIowa Soldiers Home\nThe Soldiers Home (now known as the Iowa Veterans Home) has much of historical interest related to the Civil War. The primary promoter of the Home was the G.A.R. It was founded in 1887 for soldiers of the Civil War. Today the facility serves Iowa veterans and is operated by the State of Iowa. For many years it was run with military discipline. A pass had to be obtained to leave and one had to report at the guard house shown below on return. Reveille and taps were sounded daily. The Guardhouse was built in 1902 and restored in 1987. It is located at the corner of Summit and N 13th. The cannon is a 12 pounder bronze Napoleon, M1857, cast at the Revere Copper Co. in 1862. The carriage and limber are in great condition. It is located at the south entrance of the Malloy Building. It is taken out on occasion for parades and reenactments. There is also a cannon in storage without markings and of unknown origin. There are granite monuments in the cemetery. The item on the right in the photo is a stone pulpit dedicated to all veterans. It was donated by the Trinity Lutheran Church of Marshalltown in 1995. There are 2300 veterans buried in the cemetery. At the entrance to the Home is a large park area with memorials to veterans from several wars. The Civil War soldiers memorial is granite and about 15 feet high. It is in very good condition. It was erected in 1921 by the WRC and dedicated on May 30, 1922. Also shown is the cornerstone with the date of 1887 when the Home was opened and the plaque by the Ladies of the GAR at the entrance to the Cemetery. The old photo shows residents about 1915. My Great-Grandfather, Jefferson Moses, is standing on the left. The Soldiers Home is located on the NW side of Marshalltown - take Main Street west - then turn north at 13th. Photos taken 11/16/07, 7/23/08, 6/23/14 and 7/13/19.</td>

      <td>Iowa Civil War Monuments\nVan Buren County: Keosauqua\nGPS Coordinates: 40.732650 by -91.963550\nGAR Park Monument and Cannons\nThere is an 18 foot limestone monument with about 320 names of Civil War Veterans engraved on the four sides of the monument. Above the soldier inscription is an emblem with "Our Patriot Dead." There were several limestone quarries in the region and it is believed this is a local stone. It appears the monument was erected soon after the war. There are also four Civil War cannons, a World War I cannon and a granite monument honoring all veterans erected by the VFW in 2003. GAR Park is located just west of the courthouse on Highway 1. The photo of the monument and west panel soldier inscription were taken 8/21/20. The photos of the cannons were taken 4/20/08. Also included is an old undated postcard of the park - thanks to Danny Krock for providing this.\n\nThe first cannon shown is a 12 pounder bronze Napoleon, M1857 cast at the Revere Copper Company in 1863. Old photos show it with an ammunition wagon or limber, which is in storage. The second cannon photo is listed on the National Civil War Artillery Registry as a 12 pounder iron "insurance" howitzer. The final cannons shown are identical 24 pounder flank howitzers, M1844 on the NE and NW corners of the park. The top one has Registry Number #26 from West Point Foundry. The lower one has Registry Number #20 from the same foundry.</td>
